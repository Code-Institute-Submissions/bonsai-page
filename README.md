# My Bonsai Page

For the first milestone assignment with Code Institute, I have created a website that showcase some of my personal bonsai collection.
The site is targeted toward people who have an interest in bonsai trees and would like to know more about this hobby and get inspired to start their own collection.

The photos on this website were taken by mittnamnkenny.
